Configuring Caelus Python Library
=================================

CPL provides a YAML-based configuration utility that can be used to customize
the library depending on the operating system and user's specific needs. A good
example is to provide non-standard install locations for the OpenFOAM or Caelus
CML executables, as well as using different versions of OpenFOAM/CML with CPL
simultaneously.

The use of configuration file is optional, CPL provides defaults that should
work on most systems and will attempt to auto-detect CML installations on
standard paths. On Linux/OS X systems, CPL will look at
:file:`~/Caelus/caelus-VERSION` to determine the installed CML versions and use
the ``VERSION`` tag to determine the latest version to use. On Window systems,
the default search path is :file:`C:\\Caelus`.

Upon invocation, CPL will search and load configuration files from the following
locations, if available. The files are loaded in sequence shown below and
options found in succeeding files will overwrite configuration options found in
preceeding files.

#. Default configuration supplied with CPL;

#. The system-wide configuration in file pointed by environment variable
   :envvar:`CAELUSRC_SYSTEM` if it exists;

#. The per-user configuration file, if available. On Linux/OS X, this is the
   file :file:`~/.caelus/caelus.yaml`, and :file:`%APPDATA%/caelus/caelus.yaml`
   on Windows systems;

#. The per-user configuration file pointed by the environment variable
   :envvar:`CAELUSRC` if it exists;

#. The file ``caelus.yaml`` in the current working directory, if it exists.

While CPL provides a way to auto-discover installed OpenFOAM and CML versions,
often it will be necessary to provide at least a system-wide or per-user
configuration file to allow CPL to use the right CML executables present in your
system. A sample CPL configuration is shown below :download:`download
caelus.yaml<../data/caelus_config.yaml>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../data/caelus_config.yaml
   :language: yaml

The above configuration would be suitable as as a system-wide or per-user
configuration stored in the home directory, and the user can override specific
options used for particular runs by using, for example, the following
:file:`caelus.yaml` within the case directory:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Local CPL settings for this working directory
   caelus:
     logging:
       log_file: cpl_dev.log  # Change log file to a local file

     caelus_cml:
       default: "dev-gcc"     # Use the latest dev version for this run


Note that only options that are being overridden need to be specified. Other
options are populated from the system-wide or per-user configuration file if
they exist.

Checking current configuration
------------------------------

To aid debugging and troubleshooting, CPL provides a command :program:`caelus
cfg` to dump the configuration used by the library based on all available
configuration files. A sample usage is shown here:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   $ caelus -v cfg
   DEBUG: Loaded configuration from files = ['/home/caelus/.caelus/caelus.yaml']
   INFO: Caelus Python Library (CPL) v0.1.0
   # -*- mode: yaml -*-
   #
   # Caelus Python Library (CPL) v0.1.0
   #
   # Auto-generated on: 2018-04-21 17:03:35 (UTC)
   #

   caelus:
     cpl:
       python_env_type: conda
       python_env_name: caelus
       conda_settings:
         conda_bin: ~/anaconda/bin
     system:
       job_scheduler: local_mpi
       always_use_scheduler: false
       scheduler_defaults:
         join_outputs: true
         shell: /bin/bash
         mail_opts: NONE
     logging:
       log_to_file: true
       log_file: null
     caelus_cml:
       default: latest
       versions: []

The **final** configuration after parsing all available configuration files is
shown in the output. If the user provides ``-v`` (verbose) flag, then the
command also prints out all the configuration files that were detected and read
during the initialization process. Users can also use :option:`caelus cfg
<caelus cfg -f>` to create a configuration file with all the current settings
using the ``-f`` option. Please see :ref:`caelus <cli_apps_caelus>` command
documentation for details.

CPL configuration reference
---------------------------

CPL configuration files are in YAML format and must contain at least one node
:confval:`caelus`. Two other optional nodes can be present in the file,
:confval:`caelus_scripts` and :confval:`caelus_user` whose purpose is described
below.

.. confval:: caelus

   The root YAML node containing the core CPL configuration object. This node
   contains all configuration options used internally by the library.

.. confval:: caelus_scripts

   An optional node used to store configuration for CPL CLI apps.

.. confval:: caelus_user

   An optional node node reserved for user scripts and applications that will be
   built upon CPL.

.. note::

   In the following sections, the configuration parameters are documented in the
   format ``root_note.sub_node.config_parameter``. Please see the sample
   configuration file above for the exact nesting structure used for
   :confval:`caelus.logging.log_file`.

Core library configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python environment options
``````````````````````````

.. confval:: caelus.cpl

   This section contains options to configure the python environment (either
   Anaconda/Conda environment or virtualenv settings).

.. confval:: caelus.cpl.python_env_type

   Type of python environment. Currently this can be either ``conda`` or
   ``virtualenv``.

.. confval:: caelus.cpl.python_env_name

   The name of the Python environment for use with CPL, e.g., ``caelus`` or
   ``caelus-dev``.

.. confval:: caelus.cpl.conda_settings

   Extra information for Conda installation on your system.

System configuration
````````````````````

.. confval:: caelus.system

   This section provides CPL with necessary information on the system settings,
   particularly the queue configuration on HPC systems.

.. confval:: caelus.system.job_scheduler

   The type of job-scheduler available on the system and used by CPL when
   executing CML executables on the system. By default, all parallel jobs will
   use the job scheduler, user can configure even serial jobs (e.g., mesh
   generation, domain decomposition and reconstruction) be submitted on queues.

   =============== ============================================================
   Name            Description
   =============== ============================================================
   ``local_mpi``   No scheduler, submit locally
   ``slurm``       Use SLURM commands to submit jobs
   =============== ============================================================

.. confval:: caelus.system.always_use_scheduler

   A Boolean flag indicating whether even serial jobs (e.g., mesh generation)
   should use the queue system. This flag is useful when the user intends to
   generate large meshes and requires access to the high-memory compute nodes on
   the HPC system.

.. confval:: caelus.system.scheduler_defaults

   This section contains options that are used by default when submitting jobs
   to an HPC queue system.

   =================== =========================================================
   Option              Description
   =================== =========================================================
   ``queue``           Default queue for submitting jobs
   ``account``         Account for charging core hours
   ``stdout``          Default file pattern for redirecting standard output
   ``stdout``          Default file pattern for redirecting standard error
   ``join_outputs``    Join ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` (queue specific)
   ``mail_options``    A string indicating mail options for queue
   ``email_address``   Address where notifications should be sent
   ``time_limit``      Wall clock time limit
   ``machinefile``     File used in ``mpirun -machinefile <FILE>``
   =================== =========================================================

   .. note::

      Currently, these options accept strings and are specific to the queue
      system (e.g., SLURM or PBS Torque). So the user must consult their queue
      system manuals for appropriate values to these options.

CPL logging options
```````````````````

.. confval:: caelus.logging

   This section of the configuration file controls the logging options for the
   CPL library. By default, CPL only outputs messages to the standard output.
   Users can optionally save all messages from CPL into a log file of their
   choice. This is useful for tracking and troubleshooting, or providing
   additional information regarding bugs observed by the user.

   Internally, CPL uses the :pythonlib:`logging` module. For brevity, messages
   output to console are usually at log levels ``INFO`` or higher. However,
   all messages ``DEBUG`` and above are captured in log files.

.. confval:: caelus.logging.log_to_file

   A Boolean value indicating whether CPL should output messages to the log
   file. The default value is ``false``. If set to ``true``, then the log
   messages will also be saved to the file indicated by :confval:`log_file
   <caelus.logging.log_file>` as well as output to the console.

.. confval:: caelus.logging.log_file

   Filename where the log messages are saved if :confval:`log_to_file
   <caelus.logging.log_to_file>` evaluates to ``True``.

CML version configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. confval:: caelus.caelus_cml

   The primary purpose of CPL is to interact with OpenFOAM and CML executables
   and utilities. This section informs CPL of the various OpenFOAM/CML
   installations available on a system and the desired *version* used by CPL
   when invoking OpenFOAM or CML executables.

.. confval:: caelus.caelus_cml.default

   A string parameter indicating default version used when invoking OpenFOAM or 
   CML executables. It must be one of the :confval:`version
   <caelus.caelus_cml.versions.version>` entries provided in the file.
   Alternately, the user can specify ``latest`` to indicate that the latest
   version must be used. If users rely on auto-discovery of Caelus versions in
   default install locations, then it is recommended that this value be
   ``latest`` so that CPL picks the latest CML version. For example, with the
   following configuration, CPL will choose version ``10.04`` when attempting to
   execute programs like ``pisoSolver``.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      caelus:
        caelus_cml:
          default: "latest"

          versions:
            - version: "9.04"
              path: ~/Caelus/caelus-9.04

            - version: "10.04"
              path: ~/Caelus/caelus-10.04

            - version: "v2012"
              path: ~/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v2012

.. confval:: caelus.caelus_cml.versions

   A list of configuration mapping listing various versions available for use
   with CPL. It is recommended that the users only provide :confval:`version
   <caelus.caelus_cml.versions.version>` and :confval:`path
   <caelus.caelus_cml.versions.path>` entries, the remaining entries are
   optional. CPL will auto-detect remaining parmeters.

.. confval:: caelus.caelus_cml.versions.version

   A unique string identifier that is used to tag this specific instance of
   OpenFOAM or CML installation. Typically, this is the version number of the 
   OpenFOAM or Caelus CML release, e.g., ``10.04``. However, as indicated in 
   the example CPL configuration file, users can use any unique tag to identify 
   a specific version. If this identifier does not follow the conventional 
   version number format, then it is recommended that the user provide a 
   specific version in :confval:`caelus.caelus_cml.default` instead of using 
   ``latest``.

.. confval:: caelus.caelus_cml.versions.path

   The path to the C++ code/executables install. This is equivalent to the
   directory pointed by the :envvar:`WM_PROJECT_DIR` or
   :envvar:`CAELUS_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable, e.g.,
   :file:`/home/caelus_user/projects/caelus/caelus-10.04`.

.. confval:: caelus.caelus_cml.versions.build_option

   A string parameter identifying the OpenFOAM or Caelus build, if multiple
   builds are present within a CML install, to be used with CPL. This is an
   **expert** only option used by developers who are testing multiple compilers
   and build options. It is recommended that the normal users let CPL autodetect
   the build option.

.. confval:: caelus.caelus_cml.versions.mpi_root

   Path to the MPI installation used to compile OpenFOAM or Caelus for parallel 
   execution. By default, CPL expects the MPI library to be present within the 
   project directory.

.. confval:: caelus.caelus_cml.versions.mpi_bin_path

   Directory containing MPI binaries used for :program:`mpiexec` when executing
   in parallel mode. If absent, CPL will assume that the binaries are located
   within the subdirectory :file:`bin` in the path pointed by :confval:`mpi_root
   <caelus.caelus_cml.versions.mpi_root>`.

.. confval:: caelus.caelus_cml.versions.mpi_lib_path

   Directory containing MPI libraries used for :program:`mpiexec` when executing
   in parallel mode. If absent, CPL will assume that the libraries are located
   within the subdirectory :file:`lib` in the path pointed by :confval:`mpi_root
   <caelus.caelus_cml.versions.mpi_root>`.
